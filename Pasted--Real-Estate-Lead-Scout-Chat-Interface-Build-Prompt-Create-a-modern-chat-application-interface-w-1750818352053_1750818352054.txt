# Real Estate Lead Scout Chat Interface - Build Prompt

Create a modern chat application interface with the following exact specifications:

## Overall Layout & Design
- **Two-panel layout**: Left sidebar (300px width) + Main chat area (remaining width)
- **Color scheme**: Teal/turquoise accent color (#4FD1C7), light gray backgrounds (#F7F9FC), white message bubbles
- **Typography**: Clean, modern sans-serif font (Inter or similar)
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile

## Left Sidebar Panel
- **Header**: Teal background with "MENU" text and hamburger icon (left), circular profile avatar (center), search icon (right)
- **Navigation sections**:
  - Activity (with notification dot)
  - Profile  
  - Messages (with red notification dot)
  - Settings
- **Contact list**: 8-10 user profiles with:
  - Circular profile photos (40px)
  - Full names
  - Online status indicators (green dots)
  - Last message preview or status text

## Main Chat Area
- **Header**: "Your conversation" title, clean and minimal
- **Message bubbles**:
  - Incoming: Gray bubbles, left-aligned
  - Outgoing: Teal bubbles (#4FD1C7), right-aligned
  - Rounded corners, proper spacing
  - Timestamps below messages
- **Message input**: Bottom-fixed input field with send button (teal circular button with arrow)

## Specific Styling Requirements
- **Shadows**: Subtle drop shadows on panels and message bubbles
- **Spacing**: 16px padding for panels, 12px between messages
- **Icons**: Use Lucide React or similar icon library
- **Hover effects**: Subtle hover states on clickable elements
- **Scrollable areas**: Both sidebar contacts and chat messages should scroll independently

## Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: React with functional components and hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **State management**: useState for messages, active chat, online status
- **Mock data**: Include sample conversations and contact profiles
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints

## Real Estate Context Integration
- **Sample conversations** should include real estate inquiries like:
  - "Hi Jenny how are you today?"
  - "Did you hear yesterday?"
  - "Great, what about you?"
  - "Of course I did. Speaking of which check this out..."
  - "Good job, you look good and healthy!"
- **Contact names** should be realistic (mix the screenshot names with real estate-relevant ones)
- **Status indicators** for lead quality or response urgency

## Interactive Features
- Clickable contacts to switch conversations
- Working message input and send functionality
- Typing indicators
- Message timestamps
- Online/offline status updates
- Search functionality in header

## Exact Visual Matching
- Match the **exact color palette** from screenshot
- Replicate the **message bubble shapes and spacing**
- Copy the **sidebar width proportions**
- Match the **header heights and styling**
- Replicate the **profile photo sizes and positioning**

Build this as a single-file React component that can be easily deployed to Replit, with all styling inline using Tailwind classes. Include realistic sample data and make it fully interactive.
